174609,What is the difference between innate and acquired behaviors?,<answer> Innate behavior means that the behavior is inheritable or genetically programs where as Acquired behavior means the behavior is learned from external enviroment and is not inheritable. <context> Best Answer: Innate behavior means that the behavior is inheritable or genetically programs. Example: the behavior of many insect toward attracting mates such as cricket sounds or frog sounds are innate behaviors. Acquired behavior means the behavior is learned from external enviroment and is not inheritable. Example: human learns how to hunt. So hunting is an acquired behavior.
49360,In what period did Africa beak off from Antarctica?,"<answer> Jurassic <context> Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160 Ma, followed by the Indian subcontinent in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a marsupial fauna. In the Eocene epoch, about 40 Ma Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear. During the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago, CO2 levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm."
218395,What are the symptoms of hard of hearing?,"<answer> 1 difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations. 2 asking people to repeat themselves. 3 listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need. <context> General signs of hearing loss. Early signs of hearing loss can include: 1  difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations. 2  asking people to repeat themselves. 3  listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need."
85414,Which type of birds use tools to drum?,"<answer> palm <context> Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum."
229043,"when it is spring in the northern hemisphere, what is it in the southern?","<answer> Northern hemisphere spring begins on 1 March while at same time there is autumn in the southern. <context> Therefore, for temperate areas in the northern hemisphere, spring begins on 1 March, summer on 1 June, autumn on 1 September, and winter on 1 December. For the southern hemisphere temperate zone, spring begins on 1 September, summer on 1 December, autumn on 1 March, and winter on 1 June. This question is archived."

10984,"According to West, what can people learn from music?","<answer> Teamwork and patience. <context> Public schools in Washington, D.C. provide students with musical instruments for free. When something goes wrong with an instrument, Charles West and Larry Jernigan do the repairs. Both men approach their work with a passion . For them, it's important that students have a joyful experience with music.
The two have worked together for almost 20 years. This year alone, they've fixed about 450 instruments. Both men are musicians and music lovers, so learning to do repairs came naturally.
""I have been a musician all my life."" says West. ""I played in an orchestra here in the city. I majored in music in college. I played in an army band.""
Jernigan's musical interests are varied. ""I was formerly trained in the piano and guitar. The alto sax, and the flute, I picked up while working here.""
In addition to fixing instruments, the two also go to schools to instruct teachers and students on how to make minor repairs on their own.
West believes if children start early and stay concerned with music, it enriches other areas of their lives. ""I see that in other kids. I see it in myself. I have seen it hundreds of times and it works,"" he says. ""They learn teamwork. They learn patience and respect.""
But West has concerns about the future of music in the electronic age.
""This instant age has taken away from the sit-down, the patience. And to learn to play an instrument, it takes patience, it takes diligence, it takes time.""
Being able to enjoy music on the job is one of the benefits of the job. Both men agree their best rewards are the students' performances."
5617,How long did the research last?,"<answer> About seven years <context> Everyone knows that regular bedtimes are important, especially for children. But a research by Yvonne Kelly of University College, London, shows that daughters, it seems, do benefit from regular bedtimes. Sons do not.
Dr Kelly and a team of colleagues examined the bedtimes and cognitive  abilities of 11,178 children born in Britain between September 2000 and January 2002, who took part in a research project called the Millennium Cohort Study.
The bedtime information they used was collected during four visits interviewers made to the homes of those participating in the study. These happened when the children were nine months, three years, five years and seven years of age. Besides asking whether the children had set bedtimes on weekdays and if they always, usually, sometimes or never made them, interviewers collected information about family routines, economic circumstances and other matters--including whether children were read to before they went to sleep and whether they had a television in their bedroom. The children in question were also asked, at the ages of three, five and seven, to take standardised reading, mathematical tests, from which their IQs could be tested.
Dr Kelly's report shows that by the time children had reached the age of seven, not having had a regular bedtime did seem to affect their cognition. But that was true only if they were female. On the IQ scale, whose average value is 100 points, girls who had had regular bedtimes scored between eight and nine points more than those who did not. Boys were not completely unaffected. Irregular bedtimes left their IQs about six points below those of their contemporaries at the age of three. But the distinction disappeared by the time they were seven.
This difference between the sexes is puzzling. ""I did not expect it, and more research is necessary."" said Dr Kelly."
